MazeAPI

An simple experiment in making a flask-based game.  Client and server are meant to both run on the same machine, I didn't bother to go so far as to make this workable for hosting online.  The provided client is simply a save file for Paw (https://luckymarmot.com/paw), this doubles as a set of REST tests for the server. 

To start, run server.py from the command line.  To start playing, send a GET request to http://localhost:8080.
